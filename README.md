# ⚙️ C++ Experiment 5: Decision Making Statements – `if`, `nested if`, and `switch-case`

## 🎯 Aim
- To write C++ programs using `if-else` and `nested if` statements.
- To use `switch-case` for handling multiple conditions efficiently.

---

## 📌 Objectives
✔️ Understand how to use `if`, `else`, and `nested if` in real-life problems.  
✔️ Use `switch-case` for multi-condition selection.  
✔️ Learn to use `break` and `exit(0)` for better program control.
